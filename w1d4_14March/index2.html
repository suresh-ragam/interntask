        <h2 class="sticky">GOKU</h2>
        <p>Son Goku or Goku as addressed in most English dubs, also known by his birth name Kakarot is a fictional character from the Dragon Ball series created by Akira Toriyama as the main character and protagonist for the Dragon Ball anime and manga series. Goku is introduced as a weird, monkey-tailed boy who is abnormally strong for even an adult. In Dragon Ball Z, he is revealed to be a descendant of an extraterrestrial warrior race called the Saiyans. Goku appears in all Dragon Ball Z movies and briefly in the Dragon Ball Z special, Bardock: The Father of Goku. His Saiyan name given to him by members of his race as we learn in Dragon Ball Z, is Kakarot. Born under the name Kakarot, as a member of the Saiyan race on Planet Vegeta, he is sent to Earth as an infant prior to his homeworld's destruction at the hands of Frieza. Upon his arrival on Earth, the infant is discovered by Son Gohan, who becomes the adoptive grandfather of the boy and gives him the name Goku. The boy is initially full of violence and aggression due to his Saiyan nature, until an accidental head injury turns him into a cheerful, carefree person. Grandpa Gohan's kindness and teachings help to further influence Goku, who later on names his first son Gohan in honor of him.

            As the protagonist of Dragon Ball, Goku appears in most of the episodes, films, television specials and OVAs of the manga's anime adaptations (Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z) and sequels (Dragon Ball GT, Dragon Ball Super, Dragon Ball Daima), as well as many of the franchise's video games. Due to the series' international popularity, Goku became one of the most recognizable and iconic manga/anime characters worldwide. Outside the Dragon Ball franchise, Goku has made cameo appearances in Toriyama's self-parody series Neko Majin Z, has been the subject of other parodies, and has appeared in special events. Most Western audiences were introduced to the adult version of Goku featured in the Dragon Ball Z anime, which adapted the final 26 Dragon Ball manga volumes, as opposed to his initial appearance as a child due to the limited success of the first anime series overseas.</p>
        <h2 class="sticky">APPEARANCE</h2>
        <p>Goku, being a typical full blooded Saiyan, appears with black hair and black eyes in his regular state. He is easily recognized by his rather unusually styled hair that sticks out in multiple directions.

            As a Super Saiyan, Goku's hair turns to a blonde color, and his eyes go from black to turquoise. As a Super Saiyan 2, the basic characteristics remain. His hair slightly changes in style, and in addition, lightning currents appear when he has his aura activated. As a Super Saiyan 3, Goku's hair drastically increases in length, and his eyebrows mysteriously vanish. In Dragon Ball GT, Goku discovers another transformation, Super Saiyan 4. This stage is noticeably different from the other Super Saiyan forms, as Goku's hair doesn't turn golden blond, but remains black and extends down to his back and over his shoulders. In addition, unlike the traditional physical characteristics of a Super Saiyan, Goku grows pinkish-red colored fur from the waist up and around his chest and abs, ending at his hands, which makes him appear like a miniature Oozaru.
            
            Goku was only seen once with a Saiyan uniform when he trained in the hyperbolic time chamber with Gohan his son, preparing for the Cell Games. Originally, Goku appears in a blue uniform in Dragon Ball, but he later starts wearing orange uniforms in the latter stages of the series, and throughout most of Dragon Ball Z. In addition, Goku is initially seen wearing outfits with his training masters' symbols, which are actually words written in Kanji, on the back. The first symbol is Master Roshi's "kame" symbol, which translates into "turtle". The second is the symbol of King Kai's, which is Kanji for "kaio" and translates into "world king". The third symbol he is seen using is his own trademark which is the Kanji for "Go", which means "wisdom", or "enlightenment". From the Android Saga on and forwards, Goku is no longer seen wearing symbolized combat uniforms. At the end of Dragon Ball Z, Goku drops the orange outfit and adopts a new one which consists of a turquoise shirt, pink-red wristbands, dark blue-green pants, a white sash, and black shoes with orange leg wrappings. In Dragon Ball GT, Goku wears a similar outfit, only this time it consists of a blue shirt, pink wristbands, yellow pants, white sash, and unchanged from his previous outfit, black shoes with white leg wrappings. However, as a Super Saiyan 4, Goku's outfit changes slightly, wearing no shirt (no need because most of his upper body is covered in fur), a blue sash, blue wristbands, and black shoes with blue leg coverings. The only article of clothing that remains unchanged is the yellow pants.</p>
        
        <h2 class="sticky">CREATION</h2>
       <p>
        Goku, and Dragon Ball in general, evolved from one of Akira Toriyama's earlier one-shot series called Dragon Boy. In this story, the protagonist looks similar to Goku, but has a pair of wings. The original inspiration were Hong Kong action cinema, including those by Bruce Lee such as Enter the Dragon (1973) and by Jackie Chan such as Drunken Master (1978); Toriyama said he had a young Chan in mind for a live-action Goku, stating that "nobody could play Goku but him." Goku uses a variety and hybrid of East Asian martial arts styles, including Karate and Wing Chun (Kung fu).

Bulma and Goku were the first pair of characters which were introduced in the manga and Toriyama stated that he subsequently introduced other characters in pairs because "that way, I'm able to explain the characters and their relationship to each other through their interactions. In my case, I feel that it isn't good to insert too much narration. I suppose Goku and Bulma are representative of that." He further added that "as a child, Goku doesn't know anything [of the world], so without Bulma, he'd be a character who didn't say anything." Toriyama mentioned Torishima wanted Goku to form a relationship with Bulma, but this was never applied to the series. With the conclusion of the Cell arc, Gohan was intended to replace his father as the protagonist, but Toriyama later decided that Gohan was unsuitable for the role. According to Toriyama, Goku is more of a selfish person than a hero as his main interest in the story is to fight strong opponents rather than protecting the innocent. As a result, Toriyama was angered when the anime adaptations of Dragon Ball started portraying Goku as more heroic than his manga counterpart. Toei kept portraying Goku as a more heroic figure, especially in the anime sequel Dragon Ball GT where he often rescues his granddaughter Pan as producer Kōzō Morishita was influenced by the 1997 film Titanic.

        <h2 class="sticky">DESIGN</h2>
        <p>
            The character Goku is based on Sun Wukong (Son Goku in Japanese), the central character of the Chinese novel Journey to the West. To be creative with the idea of Sun Wukong, Toriyama designed Goku as a human boy with a monkey's tail, rather than a complete simian, because the tail would give the character a distinguishing feature. He later stated that the tail was a pain to draw, hence why he had it get cut off early on. Toriyama did not initially plan to make Goku an alien, it was not until the introduction of fighters from other planets that he established him as a Saiyan. Goku was given the ability to teleport to any planet in seconds, so that Toriyama could increase the pace of the story.

Wanting the series to have a Chinese appearance, Toriyama used the color of the robes worn by Buddhist monks for Goku's dōgi. During the early chapters of the manga, Toriyama's editor Kazuhiko Torishima commented that Goku looked rather plain. Toriyama had given him simple clothes on purpose because it was a fighting manga, so to combat this he added several characters like Master Roshi and Krillin, and created the Tenkaichi Budōkai to focus the storyline on fighting. To defy the assumption that Goku would win the tournaments, Toriyama made him lose the first and second but win the third.

Toriyama's editor was initially against having Goku grow up, saying it was uncommon to have the protagonist drastically change in manga, however, he gave in when Toriyama threatened that he would not be able to continue the series if the character did not. Toriyama later stated he had him grow up as a means to make drawing the fight scenes easier.


Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee (pictured) were major influences on Goku's character.
When Toriyama thought up the Super Saiyan concept during the Frieza arc, he felt the only way to show Goku's massive power-up was to have him transform. Initially he was concerned that the facial expression looked like that of a villain, but felt it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger. The Super Saiyan form spared the trouble of coloring Goku's hair all the time for the standard black-and-white manga pages. This was the reason for the Super Saiyan form having blonde hair, because it was easier to draw for Toriyama's assistant who spent a lot of time blacking in Goku's hair. Goku's piercing eyes in Super Saiyan form were inspired by Bruce Lee's paralyzing glare. For the Dragon Ball Z anime adaptation, character designer Tadayoshi Yamamuro used Lee as a reference, stating that, when he "first becomes a Super Saiyan, his slanting pose with that scowling look in his eyes is all Bruce Lee."

Dragon Ball GT chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Goku's Super Saiyan 4 appearance, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's Ōzaru form, he made the hair more "wild" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.

During the plans of the final story arc of Dragon Ball Super, it was decided that Goku should have another transformation: The Ultra Instinct. The concept was that the Ultra Instinct would be completely different from Goku's previous Super Saiyan transformations.
